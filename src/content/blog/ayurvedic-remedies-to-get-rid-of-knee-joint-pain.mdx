<h4>Boswellia (शल्लकी)</h4>
The herb Boswellia (शल्लकी) is also said to have powerful anti-inflammatory properties and is often used as a natural remedy for arthritis and joint pain. This herb can be taken as a supplement in tablet or capsule form or, depending on your preference, brewed into a tea.

<h4>Ginger</h4>
Ginger is well known for its medicinal values to treat a range of issues and is considered a good remedy for pain relief. Try using fresh ginger root in your cooking or brew a cup of ginger tea.

<h4>Coconut Oil</h4>
If you're looking for a topical treatment to apply directly to the site, consider using a topical preparation that incorporates Coconut oil, which has analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties.

<h4>Diet</h4>
One of the main goals of ayurvedic medicine is to restore balance in the body, and to do this, an important component is a balanced diet rich in fresh fruits and vegetables, fiber-rich whole grains, and lean proteins. Eating a balanced diet can help to reduce inflammation throughout the body, which can in turn help to alleviate joint pain.
