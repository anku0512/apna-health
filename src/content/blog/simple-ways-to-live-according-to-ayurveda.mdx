 If you want to live a life in accordance with the principles of Ayurveda, here are some simple and helpful ways to get started 
</Blockquote>



<h5>1. Go for a walk with a friend or colleague</h5>
Exercise is seen as a tridoshic activity in Ayurveda as it helps to balance all three doshas without exerting too much strain on your body. It not only reduces anxiety but also rebalances your senses.

<h5>2. Find a spot to sit down and close your eyes</h5>
Taking a break for yourself is the best way to decompress and get back in touch with yourself. If you can only spare a minute or two, it can still be incredibly helpful in promoting physical and emotional healing. 

<h5>3. Give a friend a call</h5>
People who make us feel happy and loved are invaluable. They are parts of our lives that strengthens us against the everyday life.

<h5>4. Take deep breaths</h5>
Deep, mindful breathing can be incredibly beneficial as it increases the flow of oxygen and other essential nutrients to your body, thereby providing you with a feeling of wholeness.

<h5>5. Go to bed early</h5> 
The importance of a good night’s sleep can never be stressed enough. It gives you time to re-energize and prepare for a new day.

<h5>6. Rise with the sun</h5>
This is easier if you can try and head to bed before 10 p.m. Waking up early allows you to have time to prepare yourself for the day as well as take in the morning peace.

<h5>7. Bond with nature</h5>
Spending some quality time with flowers, trees, and other aspects of the Earth is a wonderful way to reconnect with nature, which is an integral part of life according to Ayurveda.

<h5>8. Visit a Vaidya</h5>
Even if you don’t feel particularly unwell, having regular check-ups is essential as imbalances, even small ones, can cause discomfort and other issues.

<h4>Nutrition & Digestion</h4>

<h5>9. Have fresh Food</h5>
Foods that are processed, frozen and packaged often contain ingredients that cause ama or toxins and can prevent nature's intelligence from reaching our bodies. For a little while, try and switch over to having fresh, warm lunches.

<h5>10. Have a glass of water</h5>
Staying hydrated is key in purifying our bodies, so drink plenty of water throughout the day to ensure smooth digestion.

<h5>11. Drink a glass of warm milk</h5>
If you’re finding yourself unable to get to sleep, try having a cup of warm milk with a pinch of cardamom. Drinking it alone away from meals helps to avoid indigestion.

<h5>12. Sip on some herbal tea</h5>
Herbal teas that are composed of natural ingredients and free of caffeine are excellent in helping you relax and restore your energy.

<h5>13. Start the day with a good breakfast</h5>
Eating a hot cereal or sweet, juicy fruits is a great way to start the morning as it facilitates digestion as well as creating a sense of wellbeing. Eating right away in the morning helps flush out impurities.

<h5>14. Try an ama-cleansing diet</h5>
Cleansing your body from time to time is the best way to reduce any ama and prevent it from occurring again.

<h5>15. Beautify the dinner table</h5>
Making your meals a pleasant experience not only improves digestion but can also be seriously enjoyable!

<h5>16. Boost your immunity</h5>
Amrit is an excellent way to increase your vitality, strength and overall wellbeing. It contains an ideal combination of rare herbs and fruits that work in synergy.

<h5>17. Spice up your dinner plate</h5>
Adding spices to your food such as turmeric, cumin, coriander, fennel, and cardamom helps improve digestion, cools the system, and adds flavor. 

<h4>Beauty & Body</h4> 

<h5>18. Massage your body</h5>
We all deserve a bit of pampering and massaging your body with warm herbal oil can make both your body and mind feel relaxed and calm.

<h5>19. Make your own skin pack</h5>
Care for your skin by using natural products only and creating homemade skin packs that exfoliate, cleanse and moisturize. You can use ingredients like honey, organic rose water, cucumbers, oatmeal, and ground almonds.

<h5>20. Give your hair some love</h5>
Eating healthy and nourishing food helps bring life back to limp, lifeless hair. So, try to implement small changes to your diet like having fresh fruits for snacks instead of popcorn or nuts instead of candy.
