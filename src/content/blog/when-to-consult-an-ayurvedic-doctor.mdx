Perhaps you've ever felt the concern of googling symptoms and ending up with cyberchondria (It is a clinical phenomenon that arises from the irrational rise of health worries about common symptoms based upon extensive online search findings.)? We all, in this day and age, have easy access to vast amounts of medical knowledge and while it can be a great asset for many, not all of us have the skills and knowledge on how to properly understand and interpret what we read. It is not something to take lightly and there are moments when it would be prudent to rely on expert advice.

The same logic applies when it comes to integrating wellbeing into our life in the form of Ayurvedic practices we read about online. Although it can be a rewarding activity, here are some occasions when it is best to consult with an Ayurvedic Practitioner instead.

1. When you are not sure of what your dosha is. 'Dosha type' quizzes can be a great start, yet they don't always capture the entirety of your situation. A Vaidya can gain a better insight of the information through their questioning, observation, and pulse diagnosis, and offer a more comprehensive perspective on our current health state and imbalances we are already aware or not.

2. When starting out. Just like when we first started learning to drive a car, we might not consider ourselves prepared and confident enough to take on the task without the aid of an experienced person. Consulting a Vaidya will help us develop trust in ourselves and our own capabilities of healing.

3. When you have chronic health issues. Struggling with recurring and seemingly unstoppable conditions, you will need more than an encouraging article or video you've come across. Long-term imbalances require a multifaceted approach and rather than simply treating the symptoms. Ayurveda works by addressing the underlying root cause of the illness, cutting it off at the source. 

4. When you don't have time to feel badly. Whether work or matters of leisure take the most of our daily life, we don't always have the time to experiment, trial & error and potentially wait for long periods of time to find relief. Consulting a Vaidya will give us the right guidance to start feeling better quickly and more efficiently.

No matter the case, if you recognize yourself in any of these scenarios, it's time to consult with a  Vaidya. Everyone deserves to experience a stronger immunity, better digestion, naturally glowing skin, stress free and active life.
