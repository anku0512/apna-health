2. HOW WE DO IT?

    We recognize the importance of ayurveda in creating a healthy and balanced life. Our approach includes thorough research of search terms in the Vaidya’s area and optimization of keywords. 
    We add our name on the google business profile so that the Vaidya gets to take the benefit of it as we are using the same name across India, which helps in optimizing other keywords.
    We start with a thorough research of search terms in the Vaidya’s area and make sure those are included on their google business profile. 
    We create the Vaidya’s profile on our website with all the links through which the Vaidya wants to get contacted, and the link to that webpage is put on the google business profile so that whenever someone comes across that profile, they can directly read about the Vaidya in one place rather than getting a scattered information.
    We fix a day when we publish post and always maintain that.

3. HOW WILL IT BENEFIT THE VAIDYA AND HIS/HER PRACTICE?

    The advantages in taking our franchise include increased visibility in organic search results, an enhanced online presence with blogs and webpage, and a trustworthy online identity with verified advice from us. Our services are tailored specifically for Vaidya’s, allowing them to focus on delivering quality care to everyone. With Apna Health, Vaidya’s can stay ahead in the industry and become leaders. 
    Contact us to learn more about the benefits of taking our franchise and how we can help make your practice successful.

4. WHY IS IT NECESSARY?

    Posting on google: This will for sure enhance the search result of the Vaidya, as working on keywords will only benefit in a particular locality, but if we are publishing post along with keywords that will help the most as it will appear in search results in different parts of India, and this will help the Vaidya gain online consultations.
    Writing Blogs: This has very strong impact on SEO, so when a Vaidya writes about a topic it can serve a lot of people who are looking for information online, and people tend to follow the writers when they feel if the content is adding some value to their life. So writing blogs always helps in gaining popularity.
