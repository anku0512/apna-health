Ayurveda is one of the oldest forms of healthcare in the world, and it focuses heavily on healthy, balanced diets. Eating healthy, wholesome meals according to Ayurvedic principles is one of the most effective ways to maintain optimal health. Ayurveda emphasizes healthy eating habits tailored to your individual needs, and outlines the importance of consuming natural, whole foods, in the right proportions, at the right times.

Ayurvedic diets emphasize eating seasonal fruits and vegetables that are locally grown, organic, and fresh if possible. Processed foods and refined grains are typically avoided to support the body’s natural healing abilities. Legumes, nuts, and seeds are plentiful in an Ayurvedic way of eating and provide ample amounts of protein in combination with grains such as rice, millet, and quinoa. Spices are also big components of an Ayurvedic diet and can include culinary spices such as turmeric, cinnamon, cumin, and black pepper. Spices can provide benefits such as easing digestion, improving circulation, and reducing inflammation.

Ayurveda is all about balance and there is an emphasis on eating whole foods, avoiding processed foods, and taking into account the effects of food on the body. If one’s digestion is weak, Ayurveda suggest eating cooked or steamed vegetables and soups to help aid digestion. Eating plenty of warm drinks such as herbal teas and warm water is also beneficial for digestion. It is also important to pay attention to food combinations and how they affect the digestion and absorption of nutrients.

The best way to incorporate an Ayurvedic lifestyle is to begin by understanding your own body type. Knowing which Ayurvedic dosha – Vata, Pitta, or Kapha – is dominant in your body can guide the way you eat by helping to customize your diet. For those who are interested in following an Ayurvedic diet, one of the best ways to begin is by focusing on small dietary changes that can gradually become habits. Here are some tips to help you get started:

<h4>1.	Make Lunch the Main Meal:</h4>
 Our body's digestion follows the daily rhythm of the sun, and it is during midday that digestion is at its peak. Lunch should be the largest, most nutritious meal of the day and must begin no later than 1 pm. Complex food, which takes longer to digest, should be a part of this meal, and occasional indulgences can be managed accordingly.

<h4>2.	Eat Light After Sunset:</h4> 
Ayurveda discourages eating after sunset, as it requires greater effort and energy for digestion and can lead to the production of metabolic toxins. A practical compromise is to consume light, warm, and fresh food maximum of 1-2 hours past sunset.

<h4>3.	Cook More, Eat Less Raw:</h4>
 Studies have shown the increased use of pesticides and synthetic toxins on food due to decreased agricultural productivity. Therefore, Ayurveda highlights the benefit of fresh cooked foods and eat raw food in lesser quantity since it puts more strain on the digestion process.

<h4>4.	Avoid Over-consumption:</h4> 
The stomach is divided into four parts and when eating, two parts should be filled with food, one part with liquids and the last part should be kept empty for digestion. Eating beyond these limits can overload the digestive fire, producing a form of metabolic waste called "Ama".

<h4>5.	Listen to Digestion:</h4> 
We often eat at set times even if our previous meal has not been fully digested. This is unhealthy and puts unnecessary strain on the digestive system. Paying attention to the body and only eating when genuinely hungry ensures better digestion and improved health.

<h4>6.	Eating Fruit Correctly:</h4> 
Fruits are packed with essential nutrients, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, however the key to taking in their goodness is consuming them correctly. Fruits should be eaten alone, one at a time, and either 30 minutes prior to other food, or an hour after.

<h4>7.	Moderation with Water:</h4> 
Don’t drink too much water before, after or in between meals. Warm water should be taken in small sips throughout the day instead.

<h4>8.	Eat Mindfully:</h4> 
Eating should involve joy and awareness of the meal. Pay attention to your food, using your five senses and avoid eating while watching television, using a phone or engaging in other activities.

<h4>9.	Use Right Containers:</h4> 
For cooking, Ayurveda recommends turning to clay pots and cast iron utensils. Food cooked in these helps to maintain the body’s pH, decrease the risk of diseases and get a dose of iron in the same process.

<h4>10.	Rest After Eating:</h4> 
To give the body some rest and facilitate proper digestion, take a few deep breaths and sit in Vajrasana posture for a few minutes after any meal.  Doing this can make a huge difference to general health.
