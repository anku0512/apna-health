<h4>Are you consistently taking the right measures to keep your oral hygiene in check?</h4> 

You brush and floss your teeth - great. Maybe you even scrape your tongue- even better. But have you heard of oil-pulling - or no? 
Well this blog post might be a great introduction to the world of oil-pulling and how it can benefit those seeking optimum oral hygiene. 
Oil-pulling- also known as 'gandusha kriya'- is an Ayurveda recommended morning ritual; used to clear potentially harmful bacteria from your mouth and promote healthy oral hygiene. It involves swirling the oil around your teeth, gums and tongue.

 Oil pulling should not replace brushing and flossing; instead, it should be used as a supplement to maintain a healthy oral microbiome.

<h5>What happens when doing oil-pulling therapy?</h5> 

In your mouth you will find 600 different species of bacteria. Out of these, some are beneficial and help to form the healthy microbiome, whereas others have negative effects on your oral health which could cause cavities, bad breath, and gum bleeding. 

Oil-pulling can help reduce the number of these harmful bacteria, via a simple process. The single-cell bacteria will be enclosed in a lipid membrane which attaches itself to the lipid structure of the oil. When the oil is swirled around the mouth, these bacteria will detach from the soft tissues and attach to the oil, eventually being flushed out when it is spat out. 

This process is similar to how laundry detergents help remove dirt from clothes. 

<h5>When should oil-pulling be done?</h5> 

It is advised to start your day with oil-pulling as it should be completed before brushing your teeth and scraping your tongue. It is preferable to practice oil-pulling in the morning before eating rather than at night.

<h5>What are the best oils to use for oil-pulling?</h5> 

<h6>Coconut oil</h6> Coconut Oil is the most popular option when it comes to oil-pulling due to its high lauric acid content, which makes it have strong antimicrobial properties. It is also widely available in nearly all countries. 
<h6>Arimedadi Thailam</h6> Arimedadi Thailam is also used for oil-pulling therapy and contains numerous herbs and oils designed to help oral hygiene. It is highly effective for eliminating bacteria from the mouth's soft tissues and is useful for preventing bad breath, tooth decay and gum problems.  
<h6>Sesame oil</h6>Sesame Oil is also great for oil-pulling as it helps reduce bad breath and tooth decay and helps to strengthen your jaw and gums. 

<h5>How to do oil-pulling?</h5>

Oil-pulling offers the most benefits when done on an empty stomach before brushing your teeth. The steps are quite straightforward: 
1. Place a tablespoon of oil in your mouth 
2. Swirl the oil around the mouth for 15 minutes. Beginners can start by swishing for 5 minutes and gradually increasing it to 15 minutes 
3. Spit out the oil - never swallow it 
4. Followed by a rinse with lukewarm water 
5. Finish by avoiding eating anything for at least 20 minutes after oil-pulling.

<h5>What are the benefits of oil-pulling?</h5> 
- Promotion of healthy teeth and gums 
- Fresher breath 
- Prevention of tooth decay 
- Strengthening of the jaw and gums

<h5>Things to consider when oil-pulling</h5> 

Some people might have an allergic reaction to certain oils, it is therefore important to do a skin patch test to determine if you are allergic before doing oil-pulling. Other than that, there are no known risks associated with oil-pulling. It's important to note that it should not substitute brushing and flossing - oil-pulling should be used as a supplementary technique. 

For the best results, you should try to incorporate oil-pulling into your morning or evening routine and stay consistent with it for at least 4-6 weeks. You should also select the right oil according to your desired outcomes - If bad breath is an issue then sesame oil might be the best, if maintaining healthy oral microbiome is a priority then coconut oil is best. 

In conclusion, oil-pulling offers many benefits when used as part of a regular oral hygiene routine and working alongside brushing and flossing. The right oil should be chosen according to your individual needs, and the practice should be consistent for a few weeks in order to see results.
